# Standard Boilerplate
This boilerplate is for a stander html/css/js workflow. You create all your files seperately, using scss to style, build the site and use webpack to minify and bundle all files. The dev environment is run in the webpack dev server, all files are moved ( even images ) to a production folder upon build.
- JS and CSS minification
- SCSS
- Auto prefixer
- Live Server
- Babel polyfill ( env ) only uses polyfills that you require based on the supported browsers in package.json
